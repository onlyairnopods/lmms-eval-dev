# Image Humor Understanding

Tasks that require to explain about the humor in a given image

## Example

A sample query in a zero-shot setting:

```
Input:
While examining an image that's intended to elicit laughter or at least a smirk, what are the elements in it that contribute to its humor? Consider the visual aspects, any implied context or background knowledge that might be necessary, and the juxtaposition of different elements that work together to produce the comedic effect.

Output:
The humor in the image is derived from a juxtaposition of expectations versus reality, a common comedic device. The top half shows a character ready for battle, implying strength, confidence, and preparedness, which sets up the expectation of competence. This image evokes the idea of a machine learning model performing well on the training data, where the conditions are controlled and predictable.

In contrast, the bottom half shows the same character in a casual setting, looking nonplussed and unprepared, with hands defensively raised as if to say "I can't deal with this." This is a visual metaphor for the same model failing to perform when faced with real-world data—test dataset—where conditions are unpredictable and varied. The humor arises from the exaggerated discrepancy between the heroic pose and the underwhelming reality, which reflects a common frustration in the field of machine learning where models often perform exceptionally well on training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data.

This situation is relatable to anyone who has worked with predictive models or in situations where performance under controlled conditions does not translate to real-world scenarios. The use of a well-known character in this meme format also plays into the cultural knowledge and expectations of the audience, which amplifies the comedic effect.
